<font color="#B2712C" face='verdana' size='3' style="font-weight:600">6' person of adverage build, chocolate brown hair and eyes, smells subtly of a creamy sweetness and dirt.
 Born in the wilds, raised alongside his adoptive elder sister by a nameless person which left him in his sister's immature care. He is fairly new to living in a civil manner, and only recently learned to speak from his sister.
 His eyes are restless, but a minor illusion masks this, though only from the passing glance.
 He is a self-taught caster in the art of Light(Beam, Veil), Illusion(Camo, Clone) and Shadow, although only just learning the later.
 He acts younger than he is, solely because his past interactions have only been with his sister.
